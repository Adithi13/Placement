## SQL Join Operations

SQL Join operations combine data or rows from two or more tables based on a common field between them.

### Types of SQL JOINs

1. **(INNER) JOIN**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
2. **LEFT (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
3. **RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
4. **FULL (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.
