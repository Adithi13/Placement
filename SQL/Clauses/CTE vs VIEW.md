### Similarities between CTE and View:

- **Both provide a way to simplify complex queries:**
  - A CTE helps make large queries easier to manage by breaking them into parts.
  - A view is a saved query that can simplify repeated access to a complex query.
  
- **Both act like virtual tables:**
  - When you define a CTE or a view, you are essentially creating a virtual table that you can query from.

- **Both can be used within SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE:**
  - You can use both CTEs and views in `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements, just as you would with a regular table.

### Key Differences between CTE and View:

| Feature                | CTE                                                         | View                                                         |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Temporary/Reusable**  | CTEs are temporary and exist only for the duration of a query | Views are permanent and stored in the database for reuse      |
| **Definition Location** | CTEs are defined within the query itself using `WITH`        | Views are created and stored with `CREATE VIEW`               |
| **Lifetime**            | A CTE only lasts for one query                              | A view can be used across multiple queries until dropped      |
| **Stored in Database**  | CTEs are not stored in the database, so they don’t take up space | Views are stored in the database, similar to tables           |
| **Performance**         | CTEs are evaluated at query runtime and are not indexed     | Views can be indexed (called materialized views) for better performance |

### Example of a View:

```sql
CREATE VIEW SalesEmployeeView AS
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Sales';
```


This view SalesEmployeeView is a saved query that can be reused like a regular table:

### When to Use CTE vs. View:
 - Use a CTE when you need a temporary result set for a single, complex query. It’s helpful for simplifying a query or when you don’t need to store the result for future use.
   
 - Use a view when you need to reuse a complex query across multiple operations and want to store it for later use, as it persists in the database.



### Summary:
 - CTEs are temporary, exist only for the query in which they are used, and are defined with the WITH keyword.
 
 - Views are permanent, reusable objects stored in the database that can simplify repeated complex queries.
